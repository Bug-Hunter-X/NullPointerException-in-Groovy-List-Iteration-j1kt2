# Groovy NullPointerException in List Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy when iterating over lists that might contain null values. The code attempts to check for even or odd numbers but throws a `NullPointerException` if a null value is encountered.

The `bug.groovy` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a solution that handles null values gracefully.
